# Client for License Plate Identification in Real-time on AWS w/ Cortex [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://robertlucian.mit-license.org)

**READ THIS: This is a client for 3 (YOLOv3, CRAFT text detector, CRNN text recognizer) [cortex](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex)-deployed ML models. This client only works in conjunction with [these cortex APIs](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/master/examples/tensorflow/license-plate-reader).**

## Description

This app which uses the deployed cortex APIs as a PaaS captures the frames from a video camera, sends them for inferencing to the cortex APIs, recombines them after the responses are received and then the detections/recognitions are overlayed on the output stream. This is done on the car's dashcam (composed of the Raspberry Pi + GSM module) in real-time. Access to the internet is provided through the GSM module's 4G connection. 

The app must be configured to use the API endpoints as shown when calling `cortex get yolov3` and `cortex get crnn`. Checkout how the APIs are defined in [their repository](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/master/examples/tensorflow/license-plate-reader).

The app also saves a `csv` file containing the dates and GPS coordinates of each identified license plate.

### Latency

The observable latency between capturing the frame and broadcasting the predictions in the browser (with all the inference stuff going on) takes about *0.5-1.0 seconds* depending on:

* How many replicas are assigned for each API.
* Internet connection bandwidth and latency.
* Broadcast buffer size. To get a smoother stream, use a higher buffer size (*10-30*) or if you want the stream to be displayed as quickly as possible but with possible dropped frames, go with lower values (*<10*).

## Target Machine

Target machine **1**: Raspberry Pi.

Target machine **2**: Any x86 machine.

---

The app's primary target machine is the *Raspberry Pi* (3/3B+/4) - the Raspberry Pi is a small embedded computer system that got adopted by many hobbyists and institutions all around the world as the de-facto choice for hardware/software experiments.

Unfortunately for the Raspberry Pi, the $35 pocket-sized computer, doesn't have enough oomph (far from it) to do any inference: not only it doesn't have enough memory to load a model, but should it have enough RAM, it would still take dozens of minutes just to get a single inference. Let alone run inferences at 30 FPS, with a number of inferences for each frame.

The app is built to be used with a *Pi Camera* alongside the *Raspberry Pi*. The details on how to build such a system are found [here](#creating-your-own-device).

Since many developers don't have a Raspberry Pi laying around or are just purely interested in seeing results right away, the app can also be configured to take in a video file and treat it exactly as if it was a camera.

## Dependencies

For either target machine, the minimum version of Python has to be `3.6.x`.

#### For the Raspberry Pi

```bash
pip3 install --user -r deps/requirements_rpi.txt
sudo apt-get update
# dependencies for opencv and pandas package
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends $(cat deps/requirements_dpkg_rpi.txt)
```

#### For x86 Machine

```bash
pip3 install -r deps/requirements_base.txt
```

## Configuring

The configuration file can be in this form
```jsonc

        "saved_data": "saved_data.csv"
    }
}
```

Be aware that for having a functional application, the minimum amount of things that have to be adjusted in the config file are:

1. The input file in case you are using a video to feed the application with. You can download the following `mp4` video file to use as input. Download it by running `wget -O airport_ride_480p.mp4 "https://www.dropbox.com/s/q9j57y5k95wg2zt/airport_ride_480p.mp4?dl=0"`
1. Both API endpoints from your cortex APIs. Use `cortex get your-api-name-here` command to get those.

## Running It

Make sure both APIs are already running in the cluster. Launching it the first time might raise some timeout exceptions, but let it run for a few moments. If there's enough compute capacity, you'll start getting `200` response codes.

Run it like
```bash
python app.py -c config.json
```

Once it's running, you can head off to its browser page to see the live broadcast with its predictions overlayed on top.

To save the broascasted MJPEG stream, you can run the following command (check the broadcast serve address in the `config.json` file)

```bash
PORT=8000
FRAMERATE=30
ffmpeg -i http://localhost:PORT/stream.mjpg -an -vcodec libx264 -r FRAMERATE saved_video.h264
```

To terminate the app, press `CTRL-C` and wait a bit.

## Creating Your Own Device

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MvDAXWU.jpg)

To create your own Raspberry Pi-powered device to record and display the predictions in real time in your car, you're gonna need the following things:
1. A Raspberry Pi - preferably a 4, because that one has more oomph.
1. A Pi Camera - doesn't matter which version of it.
1. A good buck converter to step-down from 12V down to 5V - aim for 4-5 amps. You can use a SBEC/UBEC/BEC regulators - they are easy to find and cheap.
1. A power outlet for the car's cigarette port to get the 12V DC.
1. 4G/GPS shield to host a GSM module - in this project, an EC25-E module has been used. You will also need antennas.
1. A 3D-printed support to hold the electronics and be able to hold it against the rear mirror or dashboard. Must be built to accomodate to your own car.
